# MDX for Sublime

[MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) syntax highlighting support for `.mdx` files in Sublime Text 3.

### Notes
- It works but isn’t perfect. I have no idea what I’m doing; and I could use and would appreciate help improving it.
- `mdx.sublime-syntax` was adapted from [babel-sublime](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime).

## Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/jonsuh/mdx-sublime/archive/master.zip) and extract the ZIP.
2. Move the directory to Sublime’s `Packages` directory (`Preferences > Browse Packages...`).

*This package will soon be available through [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation), [#7312](https://github.com/wbond/package_control_channel/pull/7312).*

## Usage

1. Open an `.mdx` file
2. Select `View > Syntax > MDX`
